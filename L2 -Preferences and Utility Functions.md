Definitions and Notes 
---
 1. > **Assumptions**: `more is always better`, there are no budget constraints for this class's thought experiments. 
 2. > **Indifference curves**: `An indifference curve` is a graph showing `combination of two goods` that `give the consumer equal satisfaction and utility`.
       > `Each point` on an indifference curve `indicates` that a `consumer is indifferent` between `the two and all points give him the same utility`. 
		
 3. > **Four properties of Indifference curves** :<br>
      >     (i) People `prefer higher` IC  <br>
      >   (ii) Indifference curves `never intersect`.<br>
      >      (iii) Indifference curves are `downward sloping`<br>
       >    (iv) Only `1 I.C` through `every bundle` <br>
          
 5.  >  **Preferences**: In economics and other social sciences, `preference is the order that a person gives to alternatives based on their relative utility, a process which results in an optimal "choice"`.
      `Preferences are evaluations`, they concern matters of value, typically in `relation to practical reasoning`.
	  
 7.   > **Utility**: Economists use the term utility to describe `the pleasure or satisfaction` that a consumer `obtains from` his or her `consumption of goods and services`. It is a `subjective measure` of `pleasure or satisfaction` that `varies from individual to individual` `according to each individual's preferences`.
